# Dice Game

This is a two-player game with each player having to roll the dice and 'hold' their score. Their score is the accumulated points that the user recieves based on the number that appears on the dice at each roll. The players switch each time they either choose to 'hold' the points or if their dice roll is '1'.

When one of the players have accumulated 20 points the player with 20 points is declared the winner and the game stops. On clicking the 'New game' button the game can be re-set and the players can play again.

The project is a JavaScript project that focuses on the manipulation of the DOM based on the user's actions.
